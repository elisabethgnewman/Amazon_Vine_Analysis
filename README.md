# Amazon_Vine_Analysis

## Overview of Analysis
The purpose of this analysis was to use what we learned in Module 16 about Big Data to work with AWS, Colab, and pgAdmin. 

In my analysis, I pulled the AWS US Shoes data and created four different dataframes to display: customer information (customer ID and count of instances), product information (product ID and title), review information (review ID, customer ID, product ID, and date), as well as a vine table to show the review ID, star rating, helpful votes, vine, and verified purchase).

The vine dataframe will be the most helpful with our analysis because it's providing detailed information about each review.
